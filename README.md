# SMEncounterRNGTool
A tool for Pokemon Sun & Moon RNG (including stationary and wild Pokemon). <br>
Great thanks to:<br>
@quan_dra: Whom I borrowed some code from<br>
@Real96: Who give me good suggestions and help me test the tool<br>
And ALL Pokemon RNG Researcher<br>

## Supporting the following Pokemon:
- Catchable Legendary Pokemon in SM: Tapus, UBs, Cosmog, Solgaleo, Lunala, Zygarde
- Any Wild Pokemon appear in SM (Can be shiny)
- Pokemon given by NPC (Can be shiny): Type:Null, Porygon, Aerodactyl
- Event Pokemon via Mystery Gift: Magearna, Munchlax, Machamp, lunar shiny Magikarp etc.

## Marks under Blink Column
- ★: One person on the map will blink soon, a warning for nearby frames.
- ?: The spread might be affected by the history of NPC status so it's unsafe. 
- -: The safe frames the tool can 100% predict.

## Final screen when pressing A
Usually it's the last 'A' before the battle starts, or the special BLACK dialogue box.<br>
(All button pressing and animation time delays were calibrated. Especailly for those who are using PokeCalcNTR.)
- Tapus: Tapus' cry screen before the battle starts
- Zygarde: "Zygarde has gone into a Poke Ball!"
- Solgaleo/Lunala: No dialogue, stand in front of it
- UBs & wild Pokemon: "Use this item" (Honey)
- Type:Null, Porygon, Aerodactyl, Magearna, Munchlax, Machamp and other event Pokemon: "You received xxx!"
