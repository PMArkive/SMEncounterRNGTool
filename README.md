# SMEncounterRNGTool
A tool for Pokemon Sun & Moon RNG (including stationary and wild Pokemon). <br>
Great thanks to:<br>
@quan_dra: Whom I borrowed some code from<br>
@Real96: Who give me good suggestions and help me test the tool<br>
And ALL Pokemon RNG Researcher<br>

## Supporting the following Pokemon:
- Catchable Legendary Pokemon in SM: Tapus, UBs, Cosmog, Solgaleo, Lunala, Zygarde
- Any Wild Pokemon appear in SM (Can be shiny)
- Pokemon given by NPC (Can be shiny): Type:Null, Porygon, Aerodactyl
- Event Pokemon via Mystery Gift: Magearna, Munchlax, Machamp, lunar shiny Magikarp etc.

## Marks under Blink Column
- ★: One person on the map will blink soon, a warning for nearby frames.
- ?: The spread might be affected by the history of NPC status so it's unsafe. 
- -: The safe frames the tool can 100% predict.

### Tips for NTRer when RNG with large NPCs number<br>
 1. Arrive at the final screen before clicking A<br>
 2. Pause at a "Safe Frame" (first only check "Safe F Only" to find safe frame zone)<br>
 3. Put your current frame number in the first box of "frame range" and check "Create Timeline"<br>
 4. Click "Search", now you can see the game will follow timeline the tool created.<br>
 5. Now all the frame in the timeline are without ? marks, they're all SAFE and ACCESSIBLE!!<br>
 6. Just change the filters and make another search as usual.<br>
 <br>
Warning: Do NOT change the "Starting Frame" of timeline when you are following it.

## Final screen when pressing A
Usually it's the last 'A' before the battle starts, or the special BLACK dialogue box.<br>
(All button pressing and animation time delays were calibrated. Especially for those who are using PokeCalcNTR.)
- Tapus: Tapus' cry screen before the battle starts
- Zygarde: "Zygarde has gone into a Poke Ball!"
- Solgaleo/Lunala: No dialogue, stand in front of it
- UBs & wild Pokemon: "Use this item" (Honey)
- Type:Null, Porygon, Aerodactyl, Magearna, Munchlax, Machamp and other event Pokemon: "You received xxx!"
